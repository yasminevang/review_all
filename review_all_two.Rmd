# Data wrangling 1

Let's go!

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

lets read in some data and clean names

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df =
  janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

lets look at info

Printing in the console
```{r}
tail(litters_df)

# looking at the last row of data

skimr::skim(litters_df)

#when you have characters variables is give u a histogram, sd, mean, max, min, info missing


```

so we have <chr> variables that have letters and numbers, then we have <dbl> 
which are numeric variables.
