## What is Data Science?

I'm reviewing from the first week of classes to the 6th week of classes. First,
DEF: data science is the study of formulating and rigorously answering
questions using a data-centric process that emphasizes clarity, reproducibility,
effective communication, and ethical practices.


From this lecture we learn how to load a package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Okay now we load a tidy example data set

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("weather_df")
```

Using `help("weather_df")` we can have R tell us what is in the data.

Now here is an advanced visualization of this data using `ggplot` 

```{r}
weather_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = tmax, color = name)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


## Best Practices

welcome to lecture 2, this should be okay.
